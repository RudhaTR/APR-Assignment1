# APR-Assignment1
Comparing and contrasting classical classification ML algorithms on IRIS dataset 

This repository contains a Python project that compares three classic machine learning classification models K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression using the Iris dataset. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), hyperparameter tuning for KNN via the Elbow Method, and a robust statistical comparison of the models' accuracy over 30 randomized train-test splits. The findings indicate that while all three models perform well, Logistic Regression provides a slight advantage in both average accuracy and performance consistency for this specific dataset.

How to Run
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

Install the required dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

Open the APR_Assignment1.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
